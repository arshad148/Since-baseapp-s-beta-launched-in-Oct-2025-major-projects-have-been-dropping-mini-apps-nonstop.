Standouts already live:
1. @KaitoAI: Top attention tracker. Yap to earn, real-time mindshare, gasless with wallet notifications for daily farming.

2. @trylimitless: Prediction markets with $700M+ volume. Bet on BTC/news via Pyth—faster/cheaper than Polymarket for pros.

3. @footballdotfun: Fantasy sports as stocks. Trade EPL/UCL/NFL players, win USDC prizes auto-paid. World Cup 2026 onboarding play.

4. @fantasy_top_: Crypto influencers as cards. Build decks from KOLs, weekly ETH/USDC tourneys. CT drama turned profitable.

5. @paragraph_xyz: Mint personal tokens in 10s, monetize via bonding curves. Smoother than Zora—creators cashing in per post.

6. @slice__so: Web3 Shopify. Cross-border goods with auto-escrow; even AI agents shop here, fully gasless.

7. @Morpho: Lending with $1B+ TVL. One-click USDC/ETH yields at top rates—whales love the efficiency.

8. @avantisfi: Onchain RWAs like SPY/gold, negative fees, Robinhood UX but decentralized. Traders switching for speed.

9. @RemixGG_: Gaming hub. Play/stake Illuvium/Parallel assets, earn in-app as Base doubles down on games.

10. @glider_fi: A16z-backed gasless portfolios. One-click yield/rebalancing set and forget.

Many more incoming. Early days build on @base.
